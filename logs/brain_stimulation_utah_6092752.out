Resampling BOLD data for session 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Brain structures:         left, right, subcortical 
Subcortical ROIs:         Accumbens-L, Accumbens-R, Amygdala-L, Amygdala-R, Hippocampus-L, Hippocampus-R 
Subcortical voxel size:   2 x 2 x 2 mm 

Left cortex analysis:
	Putting an informative prior on kappa so that the spatial range is between 1.33 and 77.94 mm.
		Log kappa prior range (95% density): -3.32 to 0.75
	Putting an informative prior on tau so variance of the spatial field is between 0.01 and 1.
		Log tau prior range (95% density): -0.41 to 1.89
	848 vertices do not have data.
	94 locations removed due to low mean in at least one session.
	Number of modeled data locations: 9300 
	Number of modeled data + boundary locations: 10242
